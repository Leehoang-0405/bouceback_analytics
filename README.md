# Bounceback Donor Analytics: Reducing Churn through Data-Driven Ask Strategies

### **Executive Summary**
World Vision Australia faced a critical challenge: an annual donor churn rate of **51–58%**. This was largely attributed to a rigid "one-size-fits-all" donation strategy. 

This project involved redesigning the "Ask Logic" by replacing fixed multipliers with a behavior-based system. By leveraging historical donation patterns and engagement signals, we aligned asks with donor capacity—protecting **$775K in at-risk revenue** and improving long-term donor sustainability.

## The Problem: The "Broken" Decision
The existing "Bounceback" campaign relied on a fixed multiplier model. Regardless of a donor's tenure or historical frequency, they received standardized "ask ladders."

**Structural Issues Identified:**
* **Over-asking:** Loyal donors faced fatigue and disengagement.
* **Under-asking:** High-capacity donors left potential revenue unrealized.
* **Uniformity Bias:** New and established donors were treated as behaviorally identical.

### **Business Impact**
* **Revenue Exposure:** Approximately **$775K** was at risk due to donor drop-off.
* **High Churn:** Consistent turnover exceeding 50% threatened the organization's sustainability.
* **Inefficiency:** Rising acquisition costs were required to replace lost supporters.

## 🛠 My Analytical Intervention
I transitioned the decision-making process from a simple rule-of-thumb to a **behavior-anchored predictive system.**

| Feature | Old Logic (Multiplier-Based) | New Logic (Behavior-Based) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation** | Fixed percentage increases | Predicted giving capacity |
| **Variables** | Current donation amount | History, Recency, Frequency, Tenure |
| **Goal** | Maximize immediate ask | Maximize long-term "Ask Comfort" |

### **Key Capabilities Demonstrated**
* **Risk Translation:** Converting raw churn data into actionable revenue risk.
* **Behavioral Segmentation:** Designing segments based on donor actions rather than just demographics.
* **Operational Integration:** Building predictive logic that fits directly into campaign execution.
* **Stakeholder Communication:** Explaining technical trade-offs to non-technical leadership.

## Evidence & Validation
We evaluated the model using business-critical metrics rather than just technical error rates:

* **Predictive Accuracy:** Improved by **61%** over the previous multiplier model.
* **Recall:** High-capacity donors were identified with high precision, validating the stability of giving behaviors.
* **Stress Testing:** The logic was validated across various seasonal and channel-specific contexts.

---

## Business Outcomes
The implementation of the redesigned strategy projected the following results:
* **15–25% reduction** in donor churn through improved ask comfort.
* **$775K in revenue protection** from at-risk cohorts.
* **Sustainable Growth:** Shifted the focus from short-term extraction to long-term donor trust.

##  Why This Matters
This project highlights a "Decision-First" approach to analytics. Instead of simply reporting on what happened, I redesigned the system that dictates what happens next. The underlying pattern—using data to improve how an organization asks, engages, and retains—is directly applicable to any **CRM, Growth, or Retention** role.
